Project Name: HandGestureZoom


Description:
HandGestureZoom is an interactive application that leverages computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control image zooming in real-time. Utilizing a webcam and the CVZone HandTrackingModule, this project enables users to manipulate the size and position of an image on their screen using simple hand gestures.

Key Features:

Real-Time Hand Detection: The application uses a hand detection model to recognize and track hand gestures captured by the webcam.
Gesture-Based Zoom Control: Users can perform zoom in and zoom out actions by using specific hand gestures. For instance, raising the index and middle fingers on both hands triggers a zoom effect.
Dynamic Image Resizing: The application dynamically resizes an image based on the distance between the user's hands, simulating a zooming effect.
Overlay Image on Video Feed: The resized image is overlaid onto the live webcam feed, allowing for seamless integration and interaction.
Error Handling and User Feedback: The project includes error handling to manage cases where the image might not load properly or when resizing operations fail.

How It Works:

Webcam Capture: The application captures live video from the user's webcam.
Hand Detection: Using the HandDetector module, it detects the presence and position of hands in the video feed.
Gesture Recognition: It interprets hand gestures to determine when to zoom in or out based on the distance between two hands.
Image Resizing: The application resizes the image according to the detected zoom gesture and overlays it onto the webcam feed.
Display: The modified frame, including the zoomed image, is displayed to the user in real-time.
